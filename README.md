## This repository contains the source code for the following work:
*Epidemiology of pathologic myopia in UK adults with high myopia* [[Preprint]](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.19.24317505)

An overview of the workflow is provided below:

<pre>
randomSampler.py : Python script for randomly sampling 2,000 participants in the UK Biobank with high myopia (spherical equivalent refraction â‰¤ -5D) in at least one eye.

preprocessData.R : R script for preprocessing relevant variables (explored risk factors, fundus imaging features & pathologic myopia labels) analysed in the study.

analysis.R       : R script for performing the main analysis (prevalence estimates and logistic regression).

utils.R          : Non-executable R script containing various functions used in 'analysis.R'.
</pre>

*PS: Source code for deriving fundus imaging features is available [elsewhere](https://github.com/fyii200/MyopiaRetinalFeatures).*
